work flow : 
1. check whether the client has given permission for the notifications .

2.
  - if the permission is given then send the latest token to backend
  - if the permission is on default then ask for the notifications before submitting
     - if the notifications is given then remove the modal dont directily submit the fking thing.
     - if the notifications is not given then show a warning and show a simple guide to reenable notifications and also show a fking guide on the thank you page. 
  - if the permission is enabled dont show anything 
 - if the permission is denied then show a pop up on the thank you page.

- on the admin side always show notifications. maybe you can show a simple icon in the top right corner and do it . 

- also while logging in  always update the token and try the check for the token, also if anytime the token's are invalid then. just check the specific token.
